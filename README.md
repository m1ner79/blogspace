# Starter Blog

This was created thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://www.timlrx.com) who did an amazing job üëè when he created this starter blog.

This great blogging template is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It has plenty of features, it is preconfigured and provides the latest technologies which should make blogging an absolute pleasure. It is highly customizable and relatively easy to tweak (if I can do it, so can youüòÅ), therefore I can modify it according to my specifications.

## Reasoning

Motivation behind this project is twofold. Fist, it is a part of my internship assignment, and second, I have always wished for my own blog through which I could share my ideas and experiences with other people.

BTW, if you wish to check what I was (and still am) up to during my internship then you can check my [Internship Journal](https://michals-corner.vercel.app/). There are also some of the articles which I have written so far.
