Today I was working on my CV and cover letter.

I saw an advert and I was very excited about it. Two different positions. One was for Developers Advocate the other was for Cloud Monitoring Engineer.

The second one was a long shot but I decided to give it a go anyway.

Took some time to tailor the documents for each offer but I was pretty happy with it in the end.

Tomorrow I should be starting last bits in regards to the article and at the end of the week I will start putting it together.
