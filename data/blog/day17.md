Today is the funeral. I decided to push this earlier today just in case I will not be in form to do it. I must admit that I dropped the ball this week. I wasn't updating Twitter and #DaysOfCode.

I think that if I was in the office I would be able to deal with it differently but because I am on my own in my office space my thoughts are wandering between the tasks at hand and Keith.

From "Ok, why nvm?" to "Ah, Keith.."

A whole week like that, maybe except Monday (Day 14) where I was too bloody angry to think ðŸ™‚.

Tomorrow I am starting my holiday so there will be no entries in the journal for a week.
