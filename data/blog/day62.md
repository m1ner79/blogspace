So we had our chat today.

I feel a bit better.

He said that I am expecting too much of myself. "You are junior not senior! You are trying to do stuff that it is for senior. Being an inter means to learn things, not doing them by yourself".

We talked about IT environments for a while.

He said that I need to manage my expectations better. He again highlighted that I am a junior developer.

It was a long, good call.

I feel good after it. I feel hopeful.
