Today I had my weekly call with my mentor. Just to make sure that I am on the right track( and working ðŸ˜ƒ). I have advised him that I am almost finished with the first blog. I have raised my concerns and he gave me a few handy tips. Fingers crossed that today I will share that post. Tomorrow I will start exploring Tailwind CSS.
