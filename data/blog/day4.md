Today I was able to experience and appreciate remote work. I had a few unexpected things to do in the morning and... No problem. I did what I had to do and then I just started working on my assignment. I still trying mentally switch to that way of work.

From "Am I allowed doing this?", "This feels weird" to " This is a cool way to work!". As long as I do my job I am ok.
