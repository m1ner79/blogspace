So today I started researching Tailwind CSS. Researching is a skill in itself. There is so much material out there so it takes some time to find something relevant. 

The keyword is **relevant** because there is loads of interesting stuff that can take your time in a split second.

It is time-consuming. 

‼️ Lesson of the day - I change YouTube video speeds to 1.25 so I can still follow instructions and save time 👌.
