Just a little background story. I am a 3rd-year student of Software Development course in Carlow IT in Ireland. At the end of year three, all students need to find themselves an internship or they need to do a project.
I was lucky and I landed myself an internship as the Open Source Developers Advocate.
I will use this blog to hone my writing skills and also to document my journey for the next few months.
