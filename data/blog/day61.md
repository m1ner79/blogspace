Yesterday I had an unexpected car issue and I spent half of the day at the garage. Nightmare!

Today, before the call I sent a long message to my brother in which I highlighted what was bothering me and admitted that I am not good enough. Also that I probably let him down.

Although I wasn't working yesterday, my mind was evaluating myself and while my car was serviced I was failing my personal evaluation.

I did not have a call today. I asked him to skip today so I can digest a few things.

It will be an interesting chat tomorrow.
