This was a great break. I am rested and wrecked at this same time. I know it doesn't make sense but let me explain. I am rested mentally. This break helped me to put behind me the events regarding Keith and just to be away from PC for a while. 
I am wrecked physically. I was really enjoying myself at the wedding and my better half ðŸ¥° and I danced ðŸ’ƒðŸ•ºtill morning hours ðŸ˜€. Also trying to visit everybody in a short space of time (eight days) is not great for sleeping.
