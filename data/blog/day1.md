Monday the 4th of April was my first meeting with my mentor - Lukasz who is on the Technical Steering Committee(TSC) for the oversight of the AsyncAPI Initiative and Developer Relations Manager at Postman.

During the meeting, he explained how we are going to work and in the end, I got my assignment. I need to research "How fast and for free you can set up a blog using Tailwind CSS and GitHub".
When I finish researching then I need to set up my blog and write about it.

I forgot to mention that this is a remote internship so it is somehow tricky. It requires preparation and self-planning which ain't easy.

After the call, I was thinking for a second and decided that I want to start fresh.

My laptop is 5 years old, dual-boot Windows 10 and Lubuntu, which over recent months accumulated loads of important stuff(Windows) and other not so important things(Lubuntu).
I concluded that I will replace the Linux partition with some fresh and modern distribution.

Well... That was some experience. During that day, I managed to install and get rid of a few distros like ArcoLinux, Linux Mint LMDE 5 "Elsie", and EndeavourOS.

Each gave me some issues with my graphics card. All those who are familiar with Linux, know that NVidia is not good at supporting Linux. Great Linus Torvalds had something to say in that matter before ðŸ˜‰.
Anyway, after further research, I installed Pop!_OS and it just works like a charm. I must say that it works even better than on Windows.

After installing all required software - Slack, Discord, favourite browsers and Visual Studio Code I finished for a day.
BTW, if anyone of you dear readers, are fans of dark themes(I like it dark, like my soul ðŸ˜ˆ) I recommend you to check this cool website <https://draculatheme.com> which will help you to go to the dark side with all bells and whistles.
