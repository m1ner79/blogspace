I decided to write an article about website rendering because this topic is not as easy as it may seem.

For all the people who have worked in this environment for some time, this subject may be as easy as pie, but if you are a beginner, it may be confusing or intimidating even.

I will try to explain everything as simple as possible. I will not dive too deep because the sole purpose behind this post is to give you a general idea of how rendering works.

If after reading you will feel that this was interesting and you wish to go into more details then I will provide some additional links at the [bottom]() üëá

What are the rendering types:

- Build Level Rendering
- Server-side Rendering
- Client-side Rendering
- Pre-Rendering

First, let me explain what the rendering is.

As you can see, a browser requests an HTML document from a server. Then a server returns a formatted HTML text file.

Within that file, there is the whole information about the elements (CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, etc.) required to create a visual representation with which you can interact in the browser.

Rendering is combining all that information to create a website. The way you are rendering the website means what way are all these elements fetched.

Website rendering affects how a page is indexed, which impacts Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

I will not cover indexing or SEO in great detail here. It might be an idea for another article ü§î.

### Build Level Rendering ??

### Server-side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering indicates that when you are visiting a website all the website content is processed and rendered on the server.

1Ô∏è‚É£ First, through your browser, you are sending a request to access a website.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, all necessary files (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) are prepared and compiled.

3Ô∏è‚É£ A fully rendered webpage is delivered to your browser.

Something like that üëá

**When would you use SSR?**

If your website doesn't have many users, it has a simple User Interface (UI), maybe a few pages, small dynamic data, and minor interactivity.

**SSR pros:**

- It is Search Engine Optimization friendly which means
  that a search engine such as Google can crawl each page on a website successfully, analyze the content efficiently, and index it in their databases. All this has then an impact on how high your website will appear in the search engine results page(we all want that **#Ô∏è1** page ü§ëüòâ).

- Faster initial page load time which also impacts your SEO because Google prioritize the ones that load faster.

**SSR cons:**

- It can be very expensive. When your website increase a number of visitors, with each user accessing a new page it has to send a server request every time. As a result the server must deal with high memory usage and high processing power which will have an impact on the hosting priceü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

### Client-side Rendering (CSR)

Client-side rendering means that when you are visiting a website all the website content is downloaded, compiled and rendered in your browser.

1Ô∏è‚É£ First step is this same as in SSR, through your browser, you are sending a request to access a website.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Then, the server sends a HTML text file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ After that, browser will download all static content required by HTML file and JavaScript.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The JavaScript framework of choice (React, Angular or Vue.js) takes control and starts fetching and processing data within the browser.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Lastly, you can view a website of your choice in your browser.

**When would you use CSR?**

If SEO is not a priority, your website has a large number of visitors, depends on dynamic content and complex UI(or both).

**CSR pros:**

- allows to create a website with complex user interactions.

- although initial load can be slow but after that we can see fast website rendering.

**CSR cons:**

- as mentioned above, it can be slow when loading for the first time. It depends on many variables like a visitor's internet connection speed or is the device used to access that website an old computer or tablet.

- if Search Engine Optimization is important for you then you probably need to stay away. SEO for the website will be negatively affected because the content is not rendered until the browser is loaded. I know that they are ways around but apparently these are complicated.

### Pre-Rendering
