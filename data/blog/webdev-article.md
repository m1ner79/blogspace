I decided to write an article about website rendering because this topic is not as easy as it may seem.

For all the people who have worked in this environment for some time, this subject may be as easy as pie, but if you start it may be confusing or intimidating even.

I will try to explain everything as simple as possible.

What are the rendering types:

- Build Level Rendering
- Client-side Rendering
- Server-side Rendering
- Pre-Rendering

First, let me explain what the rendering is.

As you can see, a browser requests an HTML document from a server. Then a server returns a formatted HTML text file.

Within that file, there is the whole information about the elements (CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, etc.) required to create a visual representation with which you can interact in the browser.

Rendering is combining all that information to create a website. The way you are rendering the website means what way are all these elements fetched.

Website rendering affects how a page is indexed, which impacts Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

I will not cover indexing or SEO in great detail here. It might be an idea for another article ðŸ¤”.

### Build Level Rendering ??

Build level rendering is what I am doing for my internship. I have my repository on

### Client-side Rendering (CSR)

Client-side rendering means that when you are visiting a website all the web content is downloaded, compiled and rendered in your browser.

Like on the diagram below
