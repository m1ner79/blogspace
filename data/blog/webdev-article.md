I decided to write an article about website rendering because this topic is not as easy as it may seem.

For all the people who have worked in this environment for some time, this subject may be as easy as pie, but if you are a beginner, it may be confusing or intimidating even.

I will try to explain everything as simple as possible. I will not dive too deep because the sole purpose behind this post is to give you a general idea of how rendering works.

If after reading you will feel that this was interesting and you wish to go into more details then I will provide some additional links at the [bottom]() üëá

What are the rendering types:

- Build Level Rendering
- Server-side Rendering
- Client-side Rendering
- Pre-Rendering

First, let me explain what the rendering is.

As you can see, a browser requests an HTML document from a server. Then a server returns a formatted HTML text file.

Within that file, there is the whole information about the elements (CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, etc.) required to create a visual representation with which you can interact in the browser.

Rendering is combining all that information to create a website. The way you are rendering the website means what way are all these elements fetched.

Website rendering affects how a page is indexed, which impacts Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

I will not cover indexing or SEO in great detail here. It might be an idea for another article ü§î.

### Server-side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering (sometimes refereed to as Static SSR) means that when you are visiting a website all the website's content is processed and rendered on the server.

1Ô∏è‚É£ First, through your browser, you are sending a request to access a website.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, all necessary files (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) are prepared and compiled.

3Ô∏è‚É£ A fully rendered webpage is delivered to your browser.

Something like that üëá

**When would you use SSR?**

If your website doesn't have many users, it has a simple User Interface (UI), maybe a few pages, small dynamic data, and minor interactivity.

**SSR pros:**

- It is Search Engine Optimization friendly which means
  that a search engine such as Google can crawl each page on a website successfully, analyze the content efficiently, and index it in their databases. All this has then an impact on how high your website will appear in the search engine results page(we all want that **#Ô∏è1** page ü§ëüòâ).

- Faster initial page load time which also impacts your SEO because Google prioritize the ones that load faster.

**SSR cons:**

- It can be very expensive. When your website increase a number of visitors, with each user accessing a new page it has to send a server request every time. As a result the server must deal with high memory usage and high processing power which will have an impact on the hosting priceü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

### Client-side Rendering (CSR)

Client-side rendering means that when you are visiting a website all the website content is downloaded, compiled and rendered in your browser.

1Ô∏è‚É£ First step is this same as in SSR, through your browser, you are sending a request to access a website.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Then, the server sends a HTML text file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ After that, browser will download all static content required by HTML file and JavaScript.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The JavaScript framework of choice (React, Angular or Vue.js) takes control and starts fetching and processing data within the browser.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Lastly, you can view a website of your choice in your browser.

Take a look here üëá

**When would you use CSR?**

If SEO is not a priority, your website has a large number of visitors, depends on dynamic content and complex UI(or both).

**CSR pros:**

- allows to create a website with complex user interactions.

- although initial load can be slow but after that we can see fast website rendering.

**CSR cons:**

- as mentioned above, it can be slow when loading for the first time. It depends on many variables like a visitor's internet connection speed or is the device used to access that website an old computer or tablet(old machines might not be powerful enough to handle it).

- if Search Engine Optimization is important for you then you probably need to stay away. SEO for the website will be negatively affected because the content is not rendered until the browser is loaded. I know that they are ways around but apparently these are complicated.

### Build-level Rendering(BLR)

Before I can explain how Build-level Rendering works, I need to address what is CI/CD.

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, it is often referred to as a "CI/CD pipeline".

"How it works?" - you may ask. In the most simple way, this is a modern approach towards product development. It is a continuous automation of integration, testing, delivery and deployment phases in the life cycle of a website/application.

1Ô∏è‚É£ A developer works on his local environment. Codes changes to a website, runs some test(`npm run dev`). Once everything went ok the code is pushed onto a shared branch.

2Ô∏è‚É£ At the Continuous Integration stage, a code is validated by automatically **building** an application and running different automated **tests**. If these changes break the app, then CI makes it easier to locate and fix these bugs.
If all unit and integration tests were successful then the code is merged into the release branch.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The Continuous Delivery is the part that interest us from the perspective of the Build-level Rendering. In the cloned production environment(environment imitating your end product) all components are automatically tested and once everything is good the code changes are deployed to production. The release branch can be deleted once it merges with the production.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Here is the last stage of CI/CD pipeline. During the Continuous Deployment stage if all automated test are completed then all changes are applied to a website/application.
Some would say that Build-level Rendering takes place now but I think that whole "hard work" is done at previous step. If any tests would fail now that would be more likely down to development environment not set up correctly(if you think of other reasons, please let me know in the comments below üëá).

In short, the CI/CD pipeline(step 2-4) is very good and necessary because allows you as a developer to get a continuous feedback across all stages. This is an agile way of developing an application(Chris,my agile lecturer, would be very proud üòâ).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Unlike in SSR where everything is compiled on the severer(once a user requests a website), BLR delivers a ready product to a server where it waits for a user to request it.

It looks like that üëá

**When would you use BLR?**
It would have this same application like Server-side Rendering.

Pros and Cons would be as well similar to SSR. I would add an additional con that if you decide to go with this way of building an application just make sure that your CI/CD pipeline is set up correctly. It requires to create a high level of automation and continuous monitoring which can be costly at the beginning but once it is set up correctly then it should work like a charm.

### Dynamic SSR (Pre-Rendering)

Pre-Rendering is trying to combine SSR and CSR together.The goal is to provide solutions which would allow to create SEO friendly, fast loading, dynamic websites with loads of visitors with minimal performance impact.

> _In a nutshell, dynamic rendering is the principle of sending normal, Client-side Rendered content to users, and sending fully Server-side Rendered content to search engines and to other crawlers that need it._

1Ô∏è‚É£ Just like on other occasions, through your browser, you are sending a request to access a website.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, all necessary files (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) are prepared and compiled.After that, browser will download all static content required by HTML file and JavaScript.
