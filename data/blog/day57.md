Yesterday good, today another frustrating day.

It is just like a bloody roller coaster 😬.

I already started working on the article but I had to scrap it and start from the beginning.

I just made a basic Know Your Audience mistake. I had to scrap whatever I had written down and start from scratch. Thankfully screenshots are still ok.

Rookie mistake. I guess it is expected from someone who is just starting.

Or maybe not 🤷‍♂️.
