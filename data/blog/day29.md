I spent today refreshing my knowledge on server-side rendering, client-side rendering and build-side rendering.

Re-watched some of the old recordings. There are bits that I think that I get so I just need to do more reading to be sure that I am getting it.

I need to plan on how I want to write it.

I guess once I will have the material and see how much space it needs then I will know if it is one article or a series of them.

It is all very interesting but also draining. Maybe it is the volume of the information ðŸ¤”

The main thing is that today was a better day than yesterday.

More research ðŸ“š ðŸ”Ž tomorrow.
