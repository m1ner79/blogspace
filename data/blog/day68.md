Right.

As per my original plan, I have managed to get my draft article ready today.

I have sent it for feedback to my mentor.

Now... I have a list of things to go through ðŸ˜©.

Overall not too bad. Just need to polish it a bit and add a few more descriptions to make it more clear.

Can't wait for the weekend.
