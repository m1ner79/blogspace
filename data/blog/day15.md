Yesterday I realised during my call that I was researching Tailwind CSS but I should be checking Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog 🤦‍♂️. Miscommunication at its finest. Happens to everybody. Also, I will be using a different host for it - Vercel. But all at the right time. That will be the last step for my blog.
