Typical😡. I planned today to start working on the comments section on my new website and ...👎
The first few hours I spend investigating why the most recent build was not deploying correctly.

I was getting plenty of errors but I could not make any sense of them. Eventually, I caved and asked Lukasz to maybe have a look.
He was also puzzled. I was trying to recall what I was doing and he draw attention to one of the posts. When I opened it I realised that
it was missing the metadata part. Once I have updated it everything started working 🤦‍♂️.

After that, I was polishing my newest blog about how I replaced my old blog with a modern look website. It is available [here](https://dev.to/m1ner/how-to-make-your-blog-feature-rich-with-nextjs-tailwind-css-and-vercel-3i0g). It was late afternoon before I posted it and then I updated my social media as well.

Looks like I will work on it tomorrow 🤷‍♂️.

Oh...I just realised I need to update README page as well.
