Today I experienced what is not so great about being in a home-work environment. Seasoned remote workers may have a way of dealing with distraction but I am still trying to figure out what is the best approach.

Some days I am using Pomodoro to keep myself on track, other days I have a goal and just stay "on target".

Today nothing worked. I just could not get into the **zone**. I was getting easily diverted the whole day and I spend the day doing everything and ended with nothing 🤷‍♂️.

I need to learn how to approach days like today 🤔.

Tomorrow is another day and I will do a lot better than today.
