So my yesterday's planning went out through the window 🤷‍♂️. I wanted to work on Tailwind but instead, I have spent the whole day trying to share this post on many platforms. Looks like the easiest way so far was LinkedIn and Twitter. I tried Reddit and Hacker News. Reddit wasn't too bad but HN... Jesus wept as they say.

Look, I understand it is personal preference and some people may feel offended by my observation but I must say HN has one of the least intuitive UI that I have encountered. Sure, there might be others and maybe the worst but for now, this is my nr 1. It is probably my fault, I am not Hacky enough 😏.

Also, I have updated the blog thanks to constructive feedback. And I like the look of it now. It is [here](https://dev.to/m1ner/how-to-use-github-pages-to-host-a-blog-4ofd) (in case if you missed it).

Currently, I am researching the best way of sharing your blog post so you can reach the most of the audience. Another blog is on the way.

Holy smokes! If I keep this up I will be a pro writer at the end of this internship 😀.
