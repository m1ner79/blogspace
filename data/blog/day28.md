Hands down the least productive day of my internship 🫤.

For most of the day, I stared senselessly at my computer screen. I am not sure why 🤔. Just could not focus at all.

I don't like when this happens.

Please let me know in the comments below 👇 if this has ever happened to you and if you found a solution. The more life hacks I learn, the better.

I had great last few days so for some balance I am probably due a 💩💩 day I guess🤷‍♂️.

I am not going to dwell on this. Done and dusted.

Tomorrow is another day and I will for sure do better than today 🤞.
