Along with this journal and writing a blog, I am doing #100DaysOfCode. I understand that I should be logging some activity every day but I am a dad and weekends are reserved for my family so.. No entries over the weekend.

Also, it was my birthday so there is no way that I would be doing any coding at all. Here is the delicious cake I have enjoyed yesterday ðŸ˜‹.
