What a start to a day! After all that praising first thing I had to deal with were the graphic card issues. When I booted my laptop this morning only my secondary monitor was working and my laptop screen was blank. So after deleting and installing drivers, and a few hours later I have a working system again. I have rebooted it a few times just to make sure that this is not a fluke and it looks like that the issue is fixed.

What caused it? Remains a mystery. Thanks, NVidia ðŸ˜ .
