Yesterday I was just working on the article.

Made progress. Maybe not as much as I would wish but as long as it is forward then I am ok with it.

Today, midday I just took half day.

I caught myself staring at the screen 🤦‍♂️.

I was going through how to generate documentation from AsyncAPI file in Vue application and I realised that I was just staring at the
screen. I decided to call it a day early.

I think that I may need to reevaluate my expectations 🤔.
