Today I started researching the first part of the assignment which is how to build a blog with GitHub.

While doing the research, I noticed that I need to cool down my expectations. In my head I already imagined my mentor tapping his fingers on the table and looking at the watch expecting a good bit of the assignment done. I know he isn't like that but this is what is projecting in my head.

I started writing my journal which I will be sharing on my blog. I am using VSC and markdownlint extension to highlight any issues.
