I know that I should be doing daily entries in my journal no matter what, but yesterday I had an epic migraine. So I stayed away from the screen all day.

Today it was a bit better.

This morning I had a meeting with Lukasz.

I got another assignment, and this one is a tough cookie. I need to use the knowledge gained while working on my [website rendering for beginners](https://michals-corner.vercel.app/blog/website-rendering-for-beginners) article and put it into practice.

This is a proper work on Open Source project ðŸ«¢.

I thought that previous article was tough, but this assignment is another level. I think ðŸ¤” that the hardest part will be to start. This is what I have learned so far while writing these articles. Starting each and every single one of these was hard. I need to figure it out my first steps tomorrow, and then it should get easier ðŸ¤ž.

Obviously, I will document everything.

Fresh start tomorrow.
