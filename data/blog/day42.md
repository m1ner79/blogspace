Almost there. Today I finished working on Pre-Rendering 😮‍💨.

Each stage of this article was very demanding. Researching and then reading was tedious, but not too bad. The hardest part I found was to make all this material understandable to beginners (so for me as well).

There is really not much else to add for today 🤷‍♂️.

My plan for tomorrow is to write the end of the article, polish it a bit, fix grammar and if everything goes according to the plan, 🤞 I will publish it.

Oh, tomorrow is **D-day** - exam results 😱.

Wish me luck 🍀.
