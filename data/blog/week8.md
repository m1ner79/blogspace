The weather was great, barbecue was delicious. It was almost the perfect weekend.

Why almost? It wasn't wonderful because my beloved Liverpool FC lost ðŸ˜¢ in the Champions League final.

Nevertheless, this season was amazing. Club was involved in all competitions till the very end. Despite not winning all four trophies, winning two is still an impressive accomplishment.

Hopefully, next season will be as successful as this one ðŸ¤ž.

Up the Reds!! YNWA!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
