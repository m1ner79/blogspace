I know this sounds corny but I always liked computers. Initially, I was mainly playing on these machines but with time I got more interested in how things work. Writing a code and then watching it doing "stuff" on the screen still amazes me.

I tried a few times to learn on my own but when I reached a certain limit and could not get passed it I usually managed to convince myself that I am too stupid and this is not for me.

Three years ago I was made redundant and after having a chat with my better half I decided to learn programming the old fashion way - through school.

Today I am a 3rd-year student of the Software Development course in Carlow IT in Ireland. Some days I am struggling but plowing through.

When I am away from my laptop I like to cycle or print some useful stuff on my 3D printer.
